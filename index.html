          <p>
            Currently a student pursuing Software development at Moringa school,
            I aspire to be a full-stack developer in the near future. <br />
            I'm conversant with HTML, Vanilla CSS and basic Javascript. Through
            my learning journey and experience I have been able to create
            several webpages. <br />
            I'm yet to explore more programming languages and their frameworks.
